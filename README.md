This is the backend for the vue application.

To download it, go to the directory of your choice and use the command:

```
git clone  https://github.com/gottagofarm/faircorp_backend
```

To run it, go to the created directory and run the following command
```
./gradlew bootrun
```
Be careful, as the vue app expects this api to be running on localhost:8080
If it is not the case by default on your machine, you may need to add an argument to the command
